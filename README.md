#Topic: Investigating the Fisher's Iris data set

## Project Plan
  1.	Investigation of the problem and available solutionsâ€¦ References
  2.	Writing the Python code to implement the solution
  3.	Documentation and explanations, including comments and README

## python-PROJECTS
This repository contains the project files for 52167 -- PROGRAMMING AND SCRIPTING.
Currently, The Irish Flower analysis program consists of 6 sets of code and 9 output files/plots namely:
1. Data1-Record.py
2. Data2-ScatterPlot.py
3. Data3-Relationship.py
4. Data4-Regression.py
5. Data5-Profile.py
6. Data6-Summary.py

7.  scatter.png
8.  relationship1.png
9.  relationship2.png
10. regression1.png
11. regression2.png
12. profile.png
13. heatwave.png
14. summaryOutput.txt

## Running the programs
1. Ensure that the iris-flower dataset is stored in the data directory in the project folder as a .csv file
2. Instantiate python (ipython) and run the python scripts shown above one afer the other.
3. Note that the codes may be run in any order. Each python script is self contained and are doing specific function.

## Statistical classification
In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. Classification is an example of pattern recognition.
In the terminology of machine learning,[1] classification is considered an instance of supervised learning, i.e. learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available. The corresponding unsupervised procedure is known as clustering, and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent similarity or distance.
Often, the individual observations are analyzed into a set of quantifiable properties, known variously as explanatory variables or features. These properties may variously be ordinal (e.g. "large", "medium" or "small"), integer-valued (e.g. the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure). 

## The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis [2] 
LDA is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, a method used in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification.[3]
